# Power-BI-Data-Transformation-and-Visualization
In this project, I have exclusively utilized Power BI to proficiently transform and visually represent data, while also fulfilling a unique requirement. As per the business specifications, one of the visualizations was identified as a static element, designed to remain unchanged even when filters are applied

Key Highlights:

* Leveraged Power BI for end-to-end data transformation and visualization.
* Used DAX formulas to answer business questions
* Addressed business queries and requirements through insightful data analysis.
* Designed and implemented visualizations to effectively communicate findings.
* Ensured seamless alignment of data interpretation with business goals.

This repository showcases my adept utilization of Power BI to seamlessly transform raw data into meaningful insights, facilitating informed decision-making for the business.
